Converts a HMTl file and css to a PSD, with layer styles for various CSS3 properties. Not really functioning at the moment but
its still a good source of example code for using RubyOSA to script PS.      

The project was meant to resolve some of the workflow issues resulting from designing in browser.
Project is temporarily set aside while I work on web design app that resolves the issues this script was trying to solve. Wish me luck.
